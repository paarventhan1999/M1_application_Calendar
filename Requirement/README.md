# Leap Year Rules: How to Calculate Leap Years

In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

-   The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
-   If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year;
    unless...
-   The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
